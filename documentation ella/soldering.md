## Soldering boards and their elements

_During a fabacademy class on the 20th of January, I learned how to solder small components. I have some experience with soldering, but I have avoided it for a long time because I was not good at it at all and didn't understand the logic behindf the process. Within this lecture, Henk guided us through the basic material behaviours of everything involved, and techniques used for dealing with the required precision of small components._
