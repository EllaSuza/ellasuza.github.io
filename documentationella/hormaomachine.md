# Hormao Machine

As part of my internship at Fablab, I am to work on a personal project to develop my understanding and use of the machinery. As part of my bachelors Interactive Media Design, I have been researching tools for tracking a human menstrual cycle and the implications they have on creativity and productivity. 

For my period at Waag, I want to develop a prototype designed for my body. I envision it as a tool complimentary to a clock, in which the larger cycles of the menstruating human experience within modern society is illustrated. On this page I will keep track of prototyping and materializations I am playing with.


# Representation of data 
What data do I want to continue collecting?


# Inner seasons physical calendar
I made a graphic visual representation of the data I collected, which works similar to a calendar. I want to create a a physical and tangible version of this, as a step toward my final outcome.
