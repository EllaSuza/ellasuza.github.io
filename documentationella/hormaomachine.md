# Hormao Machine

As part of my internship at Fablab, I am to work on a personal project to develop my understanding and use of the machinery. As part of my bachelors Interactive Media Design, I have been researching tools for tracking a human menstrual cycle and the implications they have on creativity and productivity. 

For my period at Waag, I want to develop a prototype designed for my body. I envision it as a tool complimentary to a clock, in which the larger cycles of the menstruating human experience within modern society is illustrated. On this page I will keep track of prototyping and materializations I am playing with.




# Representation of data 
What data do I want to continue collecting?


### Calendar prototype

cardboard : 2.5mm

cutting
s: 80
p: 75


small teeth joints are too small for this material (comes out crooked)
slightly bigger as well
I will try thicker cardboard
: s40 p95 works



# Inner seasons physical calendar
I made a graphic visual representation of the data I collected, which works similar to a calendar. I want to create a a physical and tangible version of this, as a step toward my final outcome.

Michelle showed me a Twist Lock Trick Box after I showed her the second gear print:

- this would be a cool mechanism for when I want to make replacable components to the larger machine.
