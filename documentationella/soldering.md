# Soldering boards and their elements

_During a fabacademy class on the 20th of January, I learned how to solder small components. I have some experience with soldering, but I have avoided it for a long time because I was not good at it at all and didn't understand the logic behind the process. Within this lecture, Henk guided us through the basic material behaviours of everything involved, and techniques used for dealing with the required precision of small components._




### CHECKING FOR SHORT CIRCUITS WITH MULTIMETER

OPEN CIRCUIT:
- where you have something broken (generally speaking), like a wire that has a break in it and does not make contact to energize the circuit

SHORT CIRCUIT:
- where electrons are able to take a shorter path, theyre able to bypass the load and resulting 

SAFETY:


1. Make sure your circuit is completely turned off before checking anything. This included removing batteries or power adapters

2. Turn on the multimeter and set it to CONTINUITY or RESISTANCE
(if using resistance scale, keeping it as low as possible is always recommended)
