# Cutting designs with paper


## Paper Manipulation
I got inspired by the previous intern, Asli, before me at Fablab, that did a couple of exercises with paper manipulation, where she created 3D forms through digital fabrication. I wanted to try a couple as well, because I am working towards a larger construction for my final project.

Besides this, there are some other things to keep in mind to achieve a high-quality laser cut without burn marks:

1. The width of all elements should be greater than the thickness of the paper to maintain structural integrity
2. With intricate designs, the innermost part should be cut first

## 1. Starting off with Asli's design

I find it really difficult to understand how these designs work without being able to hold it. This is why I am starting with the designs Asli made by studying procedural cuts.

- importing her design in Illustrator

- decide on scale, but keeping the ratios the same

- when it comes to image tracing, I tried a couple of different versions. The one with an output that Lightburn recognizes as strokes and not shapes, is 'LINE ART'

## 2. Power and speed

I haven't cut with paper yet, so I am unsure as to the ratio of power and speed required. I did some research online:

This resource helped me a lot: https://mellowpine.com/cnc/laser-cutting-paper/

"Generally, a cutting speed of 6 ips (150mm/sec) with a power of around 15 - 20W is recommended for large cuts like the outer border. 
Whereas a lower cutting speed of 1.2 ips (30mm/sec) with a power of around 9 - 10W is recommended for intricate cuts."



Trial 1:

circle1 - speed:30  power: 10
circle2 - speed:150 power: 15

result: neither cut through, circle1 was closer to going through

- made the circles slightly smaller to save material

Trial 2:

circle1 - speed: 30 power 20

circle2 - speed: 150 power 30

result: circle 1 cut through completely, except for it slightly being attached on the bottom edge. There were absolutely no burn marks. circle 2 did not cut through, no marks on the back.

I tried circle 1 again to see if it need more power, but it worked well again.

on to the designs!!


## 3. Design 1

- outer cut different layer so it cuts last, but same P/S

- image of this in lightburn

- made designs slightly smaller so that it would fit on scrap paper

result: no burn marks, but some parts did not completely go through. I am going to try up the POWER slightly.

#### LITTLE TRIAL 

speed: 30 power: 25
