# Mechanism Making




## Circular to Linear



I followed this instructable:  https://www.instructables.com/Linear-Motion-by-Cam-Mechanism/

- creating a cam from one of the ‘fluctation values’
- can use this as a base to play with visuals and movement of this data
- is a bit strange because i am going from linear to circular to linear narrative but I just want to try it
- After quite some troubleshooting, I was able to run it smoothly by hand

#### Whats next?

- Connecting it to a motor
- possibly a relevant input sensor like touch or temperature
- maybe just focusing on getting the mechanism to work smoothly with stable self-made materials
