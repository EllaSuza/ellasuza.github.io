# Clock charged by gears

instructables: https://www.instructables.com/Laser-cut-gear-clock-with-Chronodot/


- Cut their svg file in lightburn, because I couldn't figure out how they made the gears work with eachother.

#### ASSEMBLY

- I am using a different stepper motor than in the instructables, so will have to adjust the size of the hole in the gear that attaches to the motor pin. 

Stepper motor 28BYJ-48
- pin: 2.88mm x 4.87mm

Drilling was not an option (gears were way too fragile) so I recut them with new fitting holes. I tried a couple of different dimensions because I want the gear to sit tightly on the motor pin:
