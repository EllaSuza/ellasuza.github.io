# Hormao Machine

As part of my internship at Fablab, I am to work on a personal project to develop my understanding and use of the machinery. As part of my bachelors Interactive Media Design, I have been researching tools for tracking a human menstrual cycle and the implications they have on creativity and productivity. 

For my period at Waag, I want to develop a prototype designed for my body. I envision it as a tool complimentary to a clock, in which the larger cycles of the menstruating human experience within modern society is illustrated. On this page I will keep track of prototyping and materializations I am playing with.




# Representation of data 
What data do I want to continue collecting?

Link to spreadsheet of data collecting: 

Last year, I started writing down one or two words each day in the morning, with the intent of describing my mental state at the time. Because I wasn't sure what type of data I wanted to collect, this was a nice way to intuitively start jotting things down. I then made a diagram out of it, so I could potentially identify any patterns. This diagram below my last 3 cycles of 2022, with a first attempt at framing my inner seasons within these:

# Inner seasons physical calendar
I made a graphic visual representation of the data I collected, which works similar to a calendar. I want to create a a physical and tangible version of this, as a step toward my final outcome.
