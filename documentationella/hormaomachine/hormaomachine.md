# Hormao Machine

As part of my internship at Fablab, I am to work on a personal project to develop my understanding and use of machine-aided design. As part of my bachelors Interactive Media Design, I have been researching tools for tracking a human menstrual cycle and the implications their many fluctuations can have on creativity and productivity. 

For my period at Waag, I want to develop a prototype designed for my body. I envision it as a tool complimentary to a clock, in which the larger cycles of the menstruating human experience within modern society is illustrated. On this page I will keep track of prototyping and materializations I am playing with.

# Representation of data 
What data do I want to continue collecting?

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19G-P6-pD2CpHqEEWecpwlz1oVAlWE7LaeSNci238FhI/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >my spreadsheet of data collecting </a> 

Last year, I started writing down one or two words each day in the morning, with the intent of describing my mental state at the time. Because I wasn't sure what type of data I wanted to collect, this was a nice way to intuitively start jotting things down. I then made a diagram out of it, so I could potentially identify any patterns. This diagram below my last 3 cycles of 2022, with a first attempt at framing my inner seasons within these:

Having recorded intuitively for a couple of cycles, I had a stronger idea of what would be useful to track for me personally. I started off by looking at my artistic practice and listing out tasks and workflows I often face. I then reflected on what physical and mental states of being influence my ability to meet those objectives;

##### Good sleep quality
Did I sleep well? Do I feel rested? Does it feel sufficient to sustain me throughout the day?
##### Anxiety
Do I feel anxious/scared/nervous? About what? Can I place it?
##### Desire to consume
Do I feel hungry to read or listen or experience new stimuli/knowledge/perspectives?
##### Desire to create
Do I feel the inclination to think by doing, materialize ideas,  experiment?
##### Restlessness
Is my mind racing? Am I fidgeting? Do I want to do a lot but am not sure of where to begin?
##### Bravery
Do I yearn to be experimental and try out new things? Do I crave sharing and standing my ground? Do I feel steady on my two feet?
##### Motivation
Am I motivated to work on my practice? Do I feel the drive to create, consume, step forward?
##### Reflectiveness
Do I have the mental space to look back on what I have done and do some honest reflecting?
##### Critical lens
Do I feel drawn to specifics and details? Is there a 'judgemental' energy that I could tunnel towards constructive improvement?


These _fluctuations_ (that is what I call these variables) I then rate their presence of at the start of working day, from a range of 0% to 100%. Because this frame is very linear, I also have space for extra observations and reflecting on possible patterns.

### Inner seasons physical calendar
I made a graphic visual representation of the data I collected, which works similar to a calendar. I want to create a a physical and tangible version of this, as a step toward my final outcome.

- I made a line graph out of the tracking of one _fluctuation_ during my second cycle of 2023:

- I then translated this onto a circular calendar structure:
