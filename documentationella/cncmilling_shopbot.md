### Uses

- constructing large components
- designing in 2+1/2 dimensions


### Safety Highlights


- milling bit rotates at 18000 rpm, so if anything creates high resistance like metal, it can be very dangerous. Always check the material you are milling into for foreign objects.

### In Practice


##### General Cleaning around the machine

- Check around all 3 axis of the machine, where the paths of movement is clear and free from obstructions.

- Clean the bed of the machine, including the sacrificial layer. You can use a vaccuum if necessary. 

- When screws are removed from the sacrificial layer, it could create extruding material. Check if there is any, and use sand paper to clear it.


##### Identify material and place on sacrifical layer

- Having chosen your material beforehand, measure its thickness at several different points. Write it down. We will be using the largest value later on.

- Measure the length and width of the sheet (???? what sheet).

- Check your material for foreign object such as screws. It is very important to remove these, especially objects made of metal.
