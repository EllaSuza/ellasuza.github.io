We have five 3D printers in our fablab
#### Prusa i3MK3S
#### Ender
#### Ultimaker
#### Belt printer
#### Resin Printer

On this page you can find instructions on how to work with them, work with their software and possible maintenance. 

### How to work with:
# Prusa i3MK3S

##### Software: Prusa Slicer
- determining machine settings
- converting your 3D design file to gcode
- <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >download here </a> 

##### USEFUL LINKS:

#### WITHIN SOFTWARE

- Open Prusa Slicer 

- Within the software, open your obj or stl file

- Navigate to the PRINTING settings, and go to the EXPERT version of these settings, (can toggle between different options on the top right corner)

- There are a couple of elements to check:

    - the layer height : this refers to the thickness of every layer that will build up to your model. A lower height will offer more detail but will take longer.

    - choice in filament : on the box of your filament, details and description will be shown.

    - What printer you are using : our machine is Prusa i3MK3S

    - Infill : this is the material support within your model, so the amount and pattern will determin how hollow or solid your model will be printed

    - Nozzle temperature

    - Bed temperature


- If there are overhangs, look at the design and see if it will need support material.
    - You can specify where this support material is printed by choosing **support enforces only** found in the drop down menu **supports** in the right toolbar.
    - Then you can use the **paint-on supports** tool in the left toolbar to define where you want the support.


#### AT THE MACHINE

The interface is simple to use and control with the knob at the right of the screen.

- PREHEAT PLA filament

- LOAD FILAMENT

- Start print

The first few layers are very important, so observe closely for these.

##### Software: Cura Slicer
- determining machine settings
- converting your 3D design file to gcode

# Maintenance

## PRUSA

### Extruder Gears

- The extruder gears can have built-up filament shavings in the grooves and loose gripping force that can can under-extrusion

- opening the Idler will allow you to clean the gears and remove excess filament in extruder gears

### Cleaning the nozzle

#### INSIDE

###### COLD PULLS

resource:  https://help.prusa3d.com/article/cold-pull-mk3s-mk2-5s_2075


- If you have a slight clog or print fails, do a couple of cold pulls
- PLA to PTA filament temperatures can cause issues

- should clear any clogs
- it is a technique that allows you to clean your printers nozzle and hotend from any material that may be stuck r burnt inside

> Do not use cold pull technique with Nozzle X

> If there is no printing happening at all, refer to https://help.prusa3d.com/article/clogged-nozzle-hotend-mk3s-mk2-5s_2008


HOW TO:


###### OUTSIDE

- If the nozzle is covered with plastic, it affects its thermal properties

- To clean, heat the nozzle for 5 minutes and then turn the printer off. Immediately after that use a small brass brush to clear any plastic on both the nozzle and the heater block
(Be careful with the wires and fragile hotend heater)
