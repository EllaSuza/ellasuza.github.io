### Our PCB milling machine: Modela MDX 20

###### KEEP IN MIND!
: in comparison to our Shopbot milling machine, this machine has a small bed for milling
: the milling bits are fragile, use them with care
: avoid touching the copper plate or sacrificial layer with your fingers too much
: because we are working with very small measurements, even ever so slight unevenness in any o
##### ITS STRUCTURE

- The bed of the modela has 4 layers
copper plate in which a circuit will be drilled
- sacrificial layer onto which the copper plate goes
- an acrylic plate with a pocket for the sacrificial layer
- another acrylic bed where the acrylic pocket is attached to



##### PREPARATION AT MACHINE STATION


1. Measure the thickness at different areas of the copper plate you will be drilling onto, and write these down for later.
2. Clean the sacrificial layer clear of tape residue from a previous use
    - firstly use the knife at the station to loosen the tape strips. Take care not to scratch the sacrificial layer when doing so.
      with sticker remover. 


3. Fully cover the area on the sacrificial layer that your copper plate will lie on, with double-sided tape. Avoid overlapping the seperate pieces of tape.
4. Using a paper towel, firmly place the copper plate on the taped out area on the sacrificial layer.
