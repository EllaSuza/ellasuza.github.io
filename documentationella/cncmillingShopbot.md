## Uses

- constructing large components
- designing in 2+1/2 dimensions


## Safety Highlights


- milling bit rotates at 18000 rpm, so if anything creates high resistance like metal, it can be very dangerous. Always check the material you are milling into for foreign objects.

## In Practice


### General Cleaning around the machine

- Check around all 3 axis of the machine, where the paths of movement is clear and free from obstructions.

- Clean the bed of the machine, including the sacrificial layer. You can use a vaccuum if necessary. 

- When screws are removed from the sacrificial layer, it could create extruding material. Check if there is any, and use sand paper to clear it.


### Identify material and place on sacrifical layer

- Having chosen your material beforehand, measure its thickness at several different points. Write it down. We will be using the largest value later on.

- Measure the length and width of the sheet (???? what sheet).

- Check your material for foreign object such as screws. It is very important to remove these, especially objects made of metal. 

### Turn on CNC milling machine

- Rotating the knob clockwise

### Open software Shopbot 3

- Identify the COMMAND BOX

(image of the command box)

- By typing key 'K', you open the keypad. With this, you are able to control the milling head.

- By using the arrow keys, bring the milling head towards you so that you can change the collet and milling bit.

> ##### good to know!
> UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT keys control the movement on the x and y axis
>
> PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys control the movement on the z axis
>
> CTRL and CONTROL KEYS on your keyboard allow for faster movement.

### Change the collet

- Bring the skirt down, by loosening the butterfly nut found as shown in the image.

- Use the wrenches accessible at the station to loosen the clamping nut.

- Once the clamping nut is loose, you are able to screw it out from the milling head alongside the collet and the milling bit. 

- Gather the milling bit that you require for your project, as well as the collet that matches it.

> ##### aspects to a milling bit to keep in mind:
> ###### shape of their tip
>There are two versions we use frequently here at Fablab
>: The 'base nose' that is round and used for rounded details. This is useful for relief-like 2.5D work
>: The 'end mill' that is flat and used for regular cutting and pocketing jobs
> ###### diameter
> You decide the diameter of the milling bit depending on the level of detail you are working with.
> ###### number of flutes
> Flutes refer to the sharp slots that corkscrew upwards along the length of the milling bit. The more flutes, the more precision possible.

### Change the millet bit

(image of collet in clamping nut)

- Place the collet in the clamping nut like shown above and push until you hear a click.

- Place the milling bit in the collet until it alligns with the teeth inside the collet (??? idk) like shown above
