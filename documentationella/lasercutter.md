# Our laser cutter

_We have a laser cutter in Fablab. Although there are similarities, before working with a new lasercutter you should inform yourself on the software it is driven by and its specific machine quirks._

# Safety

1. Never have the laser on when the machine is open

2. Whilst the laser is cutting, always stay within the red indicated area.

# Preparation

1. Turn on computer

2. Put your file onto a USB (there are some available in Fablab)

3. Drag file into LightBurn software

4. Make necessary colour coded groups of elements within your design depending on if you want certain cuts and certain engravings. (refer to our Material Library)

5. Set the power and speed ratio based on our references

6. Make a small square, to sample cut your defined power and speed to make sure it will result to what you want

7. Open the machine and lay your material down. Based on how dense it is, it might need some weights to keep it in place

8. Close the machine and turn on the machine

9. Turn on the laser

10.
